the script requires 4 input to execute properly

1. a file input named "command_file" that contains the command to launch qemu and collect translation block coverage. the content looks like the following:
        '''./qemu-x86_64 -d nochain,tb -D {}  /tmp/expdata/1520403048/cb_2018-03-07-011048.976894/pngtest/binary/cb  --strict {}'''
        The command line consists of two parts. The first part '''./qemu-x86_64 -d nochain,tb -D {}''' is the qemu usermode launching command, the second part is the actual target binary launching command.

2. the AFL queue directory to be checked.

3. the directory that contains the testcases to be checked

4. the very first address to be logged in AFL's bitmap.

execute the script with:
        python check_hit.py queue_dir sync_dir start_address
to start the analyze.


After the AFL queue is fully analyzed, the result will be saved into a result file called "edge_file", which can be used directly later to skip the analyze process of the AFL queue with command:
        python check_hit.py FILE sync_dir start_address
